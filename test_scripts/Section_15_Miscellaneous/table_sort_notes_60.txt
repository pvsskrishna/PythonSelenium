Q. How to sort the table?
Ans::
    lets take one scenario:
    1. Sort all the items present in the column by clicking the sort button
    2. collect them into a list lets say list_1
    3. sort the list_1 lets say this new list generated is list_2
    4. compare this list_1 with list_2 to check whether the sort happened properly or not.
