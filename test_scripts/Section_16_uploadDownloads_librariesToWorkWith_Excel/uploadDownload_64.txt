Rule 1:

    To upload a file by clicking the upload button or choose button
    that button should have the property called type="file" in the html

    if not there we need to consult the developer to add this.
    automation is not possible if this attribute and value is not exist.

    ex: <input type="file" id="fileinput" accept=".xlsx,.xlx" class="upload">â€¦</input>
