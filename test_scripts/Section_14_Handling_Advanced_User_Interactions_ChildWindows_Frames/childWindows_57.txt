1. Selenium will not have the knowledge of the child window unless it is switched to it
because the scope of the selenium is upto the window which is opened at present - so to access that child window we need to switch first.

2. to switch we will be using the 'switch_to' method and
to switch to desired window we will be using the method to collect the all opened windows is 'driver.window_handles'
which will return all the windows inside a list with name of the windows in string format

    openWindows = driver.window_handles
    driver.switch_to.window(openWindows[0]) #0 ---> parent window

3. There exist an another locator called TAG_NAME
    driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME,"h3").text

4. If we open a child window and close a child window using driver.close()
then it will automatically switch back to the parent window
