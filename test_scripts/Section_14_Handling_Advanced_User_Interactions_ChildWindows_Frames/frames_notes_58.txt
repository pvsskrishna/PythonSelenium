*** #Interview Question ***

Frames:: An embedded html, which sits top over your base html. But they look like part of a page but they are actually not.
that piece of a component what we called as a frame - that is another page but we just embedded into our parent html

1. Selenium dont have access to the embedded frames that exist in a window. because thats a outsider piece.
so to access it just like child windows we need to 'switch to' frames.

2. How to know whether frames exist in our page?
    1. we should ask our developer or
    2. inspect to see if there are any <iframe> tags

3. How to switch using switch_to method?
    driver.switch_to.frame("mce_0_ifr")
        Inside this frame method either we can use id or name of the frame

4. In Selenium, .clear() only works on input or textarea elements, not on contenteditable elements like TinyMCEâ€™s body.

    âœ… Fix:You need to use .send_keys() after selecting the <body> element, and to "clear", you can use Ctrl+A + Delete instead.
    Try this:

    from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
    from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

    # switch to iframe
    driver.switch_to.frame("mce_0_ifr")

    # locate the editable body inside TinyMCE
    editor = driver.find_element(By.ID, "tinymce")

    # clear existing text (CTRL + A -> DELETE)
    editor.send_keys(Keys.CONTROL + "a")
    editor.send_keys(Keys.DELETE)

    # type new text
    editor.send_keys("Hello")

    ðŸ”‘ Key points:
    TinyMCE uses an <iframe>. You switched correctly using driver.switch_to.frame("mce_0_ifr")
    Inside the iframe, the element id="tinymce" is <body contenteditable="true">, not <input>
    For contenteditable elements, you must use keyboard actions instead of .clear()

5. so when user goes inside the frame how can he come back to the window.
    driver.switch_to.default_content()

    using this above method user can come back to the normal browser scope
