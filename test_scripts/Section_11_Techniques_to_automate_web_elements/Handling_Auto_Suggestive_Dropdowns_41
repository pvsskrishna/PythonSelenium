 - This is not a Select tag
 here we will be using find elements to extract all the elements into a list
 we will iterate them until our desired value is found by using the .text method

 example:
 --------
dropdown = driver.find_element(By.ID,"autosuggest")
dropdown.send_keys("ind")
countries = driver.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR,"li[class ='ui-menu-item'] a")
print(len(countries))

for country in countries:
    if country.text == 'India':
        print("India")
        country.click()
        break


.text
------
    text method will work only on the elements which are loaded when the page is loaded
    it wont work for the elements which are generating after manipulation
    ex: for auto suggestive drop down values we cant find the text directly, because the values are not preloaded.
