for handling popups first we need to switch to that popup/alert
    alert = driver.switch_to.alert

next, we can grab the text from it using the method called text
    alert_text = alert.text
    print(alert_text)

to click ok in alert, we will use method accept()
    alert.accept()

to click cancel in alert, we will use method dismiss()
    alert.dismiss()
