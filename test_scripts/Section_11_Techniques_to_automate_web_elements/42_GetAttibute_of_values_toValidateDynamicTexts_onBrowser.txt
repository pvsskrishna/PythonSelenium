To overcome the restriction in .text method we are using this get_attribute('attribute_name') method
To extract the text which .text cant extract, we will use this get_attribute() method when the text is entered dynamically

get_attribute("attribute_name"):
--------------------------------
    used to get the attribute and its values
    it's a javascript method

    Ex:
        dropdown = driver.find_element(By.ID,"autosuggest")
        print(dropdown.text)
        print(dropdown.get_attribute("value"))

Interview Question:
-------------------
Q. When you update value dynamically through script how do you extract the text?
Ans: we cant use this .text method
    because it cant extract the text which is displayed dynamically and which is not loaded when page is loaded.
    we use the get_attribute("value") which will get the values which were entered dynamically through the script.
