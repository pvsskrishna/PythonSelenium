Locators:
---------
    1. ID
    2. Name
    3. Class Name
    4. Link_Text
    5. Partial link text
    6. CSS Selector
    7. Xpath
    8. Tag name

Syntax:
-------
    driver.find_element(By.locator_name,"attribute_value")

    css_selector:
    -------------
        1. driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR,"tagname[attribute_name = 'value']")

        2. or we can also write the css_selector without using the attribute and its value just by giving the path to it.
        ex:
        driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR,"form div:nth-child(1) input")


    xpath:
    ------
        1. driver.find_element(By.XPATH,"//tagname[@attribute_name = 'value']")

        2. or we can also write the xpath without using the attribute and its value just by giving the path to it.
        ex:

        driver.find_element(By.XPATH,"//input/div[1]/input")

        ---> here the difference between the xpath and css_selector is "space" is replaced with the "slashes"

        3. locator LINK_TEXT and PARTIAL_LINK_TEXT will be used only if the tag name is having the tag "a".
        but using the XPATH we can find the elements using the text available.

        driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//button[text()='Save New Password']")
