Command 6:
    # Concept is how will you run only smoke test cases or regression test cases etc...
    we cant keep the names smoke, regression etc.. these testing names in the method/testcase name

    so we will go with concept called "MARK"
    in Cucumber we called it as "Tags" in TestNg we called it as "Groups"

    Below is the syntax to mark the test case
    ---------------------
    pytest.mark.marmName
    ---------------------

    Ex:
        @pytest.mark.smoke
        def test_firstprogram():
            print('hello')

    Command to execute the marked test cases is
    --------------------------
    py.test -m markName -v -s
    --------------------------
    here -m means mark

        Ex: py.test -m smoke -v -s

    Q. How to skip a test case using marks?
    Ans: There are some predefined marks in pytest, one of them is skip mark
        ------------------------
            @pytest.mark.skip
        ------------------------

        Ex:
            @pytest.mark.skip
            @pytest.mark.smoke
            def test_thirdprogram():
                print('Good afternoon')
