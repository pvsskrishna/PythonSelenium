Base concept of fixture is :: Used for Setup and Teardown process.

Importance :
    used mostly for:
    1. Browser setups/ opening browsers
    2. Setting up some data base instances
    3. Creating some configuration properties
    4. Environment variables
    It's all like pre-request stuff


Annotation should be:
    ----------------
    pytest.fixture()
    -----------------

    it will be written on anywhere but on top of the method/test case just like marks. then it will be treated as fixture.


Q. Scenario how will the methods know about the fixture?
    ---> so we need to pass the fixture method inside the test method as an argument so that fixture will execute.
        this is how we will give connection between the test method and the fixture


    Ex:1
     py.test test_fixturedemo.py -v -s

        def test_CreditCard1():
            print("Credit1")

        @pytest.fixture
        def setup():
            print("I will be executed first")

        def test_testFixtureDemo(setup):
            print("I will execute steps in fixtureDemo method")

        Output:
            test_fixturedemo.py::test_CreditCard1 Credit1
            PASSED
            test_fixturedemo.py::test_testFixtureDemo I will be executed first
            I will execute steps in fixtureDemo method
            PASSED

     Ex: 2
     py.test test_fixturedemo.py -v -s

         def test_CreditCard1():
            print("Credit1")


        @pytest.fixture
        def setup():
            print("I will be executed first")
            yield
            print('I will be executing last')


        def test_testFixtureDemo(setup):
            print("I will execute steps in fixtureDemo method")

        Output:
        test_fixturedemo.py::test_CreditCard1 Credit1
        PASSED
        test_fixturedemo.py::test_testFixtureDemo I will be executed first
        I will execute steps in fixtureDemo method
        PASSED I will be executing last
