Command 6:
    # Concept is how will you run only smoke test cases or regression test cases etc...
    we cant keep the names smoke, regression etc.. these testing names in the method/testcase name

    so we will go with concept called "MARK"
    in Cucumber we called it as "Tags" in TestNg we called it as "Groups"

    Below is the syntax to mark the test case
    ---------------------
    pytest.mark.marmName
    ---------------------

    Ex:
        @pytest.mark.smoke
        def test_firstprogram():
            print('hello')

    Command to execute the marked test cases is
    --------------------------
    py.test -m markName -v -s
    --------------------------
    here -m means mark

        Ex: py.test -m smoke -v -s

    Q. How to skip a test case using marks?
    Ans: There are some predefined marks in pytest, one of them is skip mark
        ------------------------
            @pytest.mark.skip
        ------------------------

        Ex:
            @pytest.mark.skip
            @pytest.mark.smoke
            def test_thirdprogram():
                print('Good afternoon')


        ---> mostly, we will be using this skip mark to avoid testcases which are failing.


    Q. How to make the test case run but in output we dont want about Pass or Fail?
        like running the test case but not reporting.

    -------------------
    @pytest.mark.xfail
    -------------------

    ex:
        test_demo4_76.py::test_secondprogram FAILED                            [ 25%]
        test_demo4_76.py::test_fourthprogram PASSED                            [ 50%]
    --> test_demo4_76.py::test_CreditCard2 XPASS                               [ 75%]
        test_demo4_76.py::test_CreditCard3 SKIPPED (unconditional skip)        [100%]
